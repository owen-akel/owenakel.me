# Dali WebDev Challenge Submission
## owenakel.me
### 1. Project Description

owenakel.me is a mulit-page personal website. The website features a home page which contains a menubar, as well as links to social media accounts.
In the menubar are links to the "About" and "Experience" sections of the website ("Experience" is a sub section of the "About" page). The About page
includes a short biography about myself, as well as briefly details my experience with computer programming thus far. Some key features of this webpage
include: home page animations and a expandable and collapsible sidebar menu on the "About" page. I used css and javascript to encode these features.

### 2. Project Limitations & Future Direction

owenakel.me works most optimally on a screen approximately 2560 x 1600 pixels. In the future — to further develop — this product, I would look to create
breakpoints to allow for compatablility across different size computer screens, as well as mobile devices.
