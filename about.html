                    I was born in Arkansas, but moved to San Francisco at the age of three where
                    I attended middle and high school before relocating across the country
                    to Dartmouth for college (I am currently a '26!). At Dartmouth, I plan to study Computer 
                    Science and Economics, though I am also interested in music and Latin.

                    Extracurricularly, I am involved in 
                    <a class="in_text_link" href="https://tamidgroup.org/consulting/" target="_blank">TAMID Dartmouth College</a> and the
                    <a class="in_text_link" href="https://dippnh.org/" target="_blank">Dartmouth Investment and Philanthropy Program</a>. 
                    I also like to play basketball (I'm on the club basketball team), practice guitar, listen to
                    music, and spend time outdoors with my friends.

                In high school, I worked extensively with Python and Java (and briefly with C and C++ through arduino). I've since 
                further developed these skills at Dartmouth in CS 1 and 10, as well as gained experience using Selenium and Selenium
                WebDriver through my work with TAMID.

                This website is my first experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have really enjoyed teaching myself about webdev
                and hope to continue learning and building my skills at DALI!
